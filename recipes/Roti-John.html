        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This popular street food in Singapore and Malaysia brings together an impressive line-up of ingredients: minced meat, a freshly cooked omelette, cheese, iceberg lettuce and lashings of sauces on a soft hotdog roll.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 onion, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>100g beef mince</li>
            <li>2 tbsp chilli paste</li>
            <li>6 eggs, beaten very well</li>
            <li>4 spring onions, sliced</li>
            <li>salt and pepper, to season</li>
            <li>25g softened butter</li>
            <li>2 long hot dog rolls, split in half lengthways leaving a hinge</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a medium frying pan over medium heat and add the vegetable oil, onion and garlic. Fry until fragrant, then add the mince and chilli paste. Once the meat is browned and cooked through, remove from the pan and allow to cool slightly.</li>
            <li>Combine the beaten egg, spring onions and mince mixture and season well with salt and pepper. Heat a large frying pan over medium heat and grease with some of the butter. Pour or ladle half the egg mixture into the pan in roughly the shape of a split hot dog roll. Place a hot dog roll on top and butter the top of the roll. Fry until the egg is cooked, then flip the mixture and fry the top of the bun until lightly toasted. Remove from the pan and repeat with the remaining egg mixture and hot dog roll.</li>
            <li>Fold in any omelette edges, then top with cheese, lettuce, cucumber and onion. Drizzle with mayonnaise, tomato sauce and sriracha.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
